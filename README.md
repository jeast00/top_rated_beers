# TopRatedBeers

Welcome to Top Rated Beers! This CLI application allows the user to enter user input to show a list of the top rated beers across the world, and then allows the user to input a number and view the details of that selected beer.  

## Installation

Make sure the repo has been cloned and forked on an IDE before running the application.

In the terminal, type:

    $ ./bin/top-rated-beers

If that does not work, type:

    $ ruby ./bin/top-rated-beers

If the application does not run, ensure the user has installed the gems and then try again.  To install the gems, type:

    $bundle install

## Usage

Instructions:

The instructions are provided within the application and will
also be provided here.

Once the application loads, the user will be prompted to type
'list' and press the 'enter' key to see the list of beers.

Once the list loads, the user will be prompted to enter a number
between 1-50 or will need to 'type' exit to end the program.

## Development

There was no local testing for this application.  This application was built from the ground up and tested within the terminal to ensure the code was properly working.  This application was built from the ground up with the help of countless hours of google searching, the inspiration of learning to code with Flatiron School, and the never ending support from students and staff.
